run main.m

select Bragg grating design file

The program will generate plots showing the gratings, its sepectral response, and the result from applying a 5ps input gaussian pulse.

Check parameters at the begining of main.m.

Bandwidth and grating size can be modified by using the parameter ScalingFactor.
